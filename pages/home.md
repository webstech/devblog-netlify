## Greetings

Welcome to a dev site.  This is a work in progress.  Bits may be used
to create other sites (yes, I will literally split bits from bytes).
On this site they are a work in progress.

The underlying source is generated from nunjucks.  Not sure I am really happy
with that at this time - still learning.

## History

This is based on a template for building a simple blog website with the [Eleventy static site generator](https://www.11ty.io), with deployment to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

Includes [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org) for WYSIWYG content editing, and [Netlify Forms](https://www.netlify.com/docs/form-handling) for processing your site's form data.

For more info on installation and usage, view the [project repo]({{ pkg.repository.url }}) on Github.
