# Toil and Trouble Blog and Testing Platform

## What is it?

An insane experiment using a simple template for building a fast, static website using the [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/) static site generator, with [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) baked-in, ready to deploy to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) in a couple of clicks.

Based on the [Eleventy Base Blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) repo (see there for additional info on Eleventy usage).

## Features

* Slowly none of the original repo.  Trying to put in a credit to the original provider.

## Gotchas

If you change the repo that was created at deploy time from public to private, you'll need to regenerate your token,
as the token generated using the deploy to Netlify button can only access public repositories. To
regenerate your token, head to "Settings" in your Netlify site dashboard, go to the "Identity"
section, then scroll to "Services" where you'll see an "Edit settings" button. Click that and you'll
see a text link to "Generate access token in GitHub".

## Local development

### 1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/danurbanowicz/eleventy-netlify-boilerplate.git my-blog-name
```


### 2. Navigate to the directory

```
cd my-blog-name
```

Specifically have a look at `.eleventy.js` to see if you want to configure any Eleventy options differently.

### 3. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

### 4. Edit _data/metadata.json

This file contains your site title and author details.

### 5. Run Eleventy (builds the site)

```
npx eleventy
```

Or build automatically when a template changes:
```
npx eleventy --watch
```

Or in debug mode:
```
DEBUG=* npx eleventy
```
